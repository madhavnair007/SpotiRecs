Madhav Nair, Bhuvan Hospet, Brianna Quinn

SpotiRecs is a full-stack application that will analyze one's inputted playlist and determine a recommended song to add based on the types of songs in the playlist currently. We will be utilizing the Spotify API to querry different songs and their attributes (genre, artist, length, etc.). Using this information, we will deploy machine learning algorithms to establish what song to add to continue the same vibe of the playlist.
